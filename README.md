# gfac R package
The package contains several factor analysis methods, with
emphasis to count data. The main methods rely on copulas to estimate the
residual covariance, not explained by the latent structure. Additionally, the
package contains four data sets for empirical evaluation and one baseline
model. The methods use RStan for inference, the only exception is the
iPoiss method where we use conjugate posterior.

# Installation
Download the contents of the package to a local folder. Then use

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install("path", quick = TRUE)
``` 
where path is the path to the folder where you saved the contents of the package. The parameter `quick = TRUE` allows to install already compiled models in the package. If you want to re-compile the models on your computer, you can install the package directly from git with

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bstatcomp/gfac")
``` 

If you are installing this way, you may have trouble installing the 32-bit and 64-bit versions on Windows. In 
that case only install one version with

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bstatcomp/gfac", INSTALL_opts = c("--no-multiarch"))
``` 

which will automatically install the arch that is used in your current RStudio
session. If it still does not install, you may need to check your system Path,
where the compiler for the desired version should be before the compiler for
the other version.

# Use
The main functionality of the package is training and predicting with
different factor analysis methods. For that, you only need to use functions
starting with *train_* and *pred_*. Additionally there are four sports count 
data 
sets that can be used for the training and evaluation. The data are from the
English association football Premier League (EPL), National Basketball 
Association
(NBA), National Football League (NFL), and esports League of Legends Champions
Korea (LCK).

For example, to train, predict, and evaluate
the copula negative binomial factor analysis method on EPL data, use

```{r eval = FALSE}
data(EPL_data)
train_ind <- EPL_data$splits[ ,1] == 2
test_ind  <- EPL_data$splits[ ,1] == 1
train_dat <- EPL_data$fa_data[train_ind, ]
train_grp <- EPL_data$group[train_ind]
test_dat  <- EPL_data$fa_data[test_ind, ]
test_grp  <- EPL_data$group[test_ind]

my_model <- train_CgNBFA(train_dat, train_grp)
my_eval  <- pred_CgNBFA(my_model, test_grp, test_dat)
mean(my_eval$lpd)
my_eval$predictions # get predictions for all observations in the test set
``` 

Inputs to other methods are similar, for details see documentation.
